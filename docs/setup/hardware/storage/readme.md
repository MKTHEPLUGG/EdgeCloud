# Storage (WIP)

in this section I will show you some ways to enhance the storage experience on our SBC's.

## USB NVME Adapter 

My personal favorite for its simplicity. I buy mine from [this](https://www.amazon.com.be/-/en/dp/B07ZNVK9K2?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) seller on amazon.
This method is supported on any device with an usb port. The main drawback of this method is the bottleneck generated by using usb instead of a native NVME port. However compared to a SD Card this solution still provides speeds up to 5 times higher.


You'll need to configure the board to boot from the ssd. We'll be using a sd card to boot afterwards we'll mount the ssd to serve as the main OS disk. In some cases the board might support booting straight to the SSD.

follow the guide in .create-bootable-device.md to create a bootable device.

once you have created a storage device you can configure the SBC to boot from it either using an intermediate device or not if your board supports this.

### Configure

### [Rock5a](https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock5/install)

### ARMbian

1. **Configure U-Boot to Boot from USB**:
   - Point variable in the u-boot env configuration file to new Storage Device, reboot to apply:
     ```bash
     sudo sed -i 's/^rootdev=.*/rootdev=UUID=your-new-uuid/' /boot/armbianEnv.txt
     sudo reboot now
     ```
