# Hardware

in my search for a good SBC I've been trying out serveral boards. In this section of the repo I will document each one. You will see that most of the boards we use share common issues like only having an SD Card for storage by default. I'll show you some ways how you might get around this limitation.

## Raspberry Pi 4

one of the most commonly used SBC's

## Quartz4a

Less known but has great options for storage. Can be used to create a DIY Nas.

## [Rock5a](https://magazinmehatronika.com/en/radxa-rock-5a-review/)

The main powerhouse SBC that I will use that has only been available since Q2 2023 is the **Rock5a**. In our case this SBC is perfect because it offers a lot of compute not currently available in other SBC's.
