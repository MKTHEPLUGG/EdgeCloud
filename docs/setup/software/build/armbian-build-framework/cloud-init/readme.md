# enable cloud init via armbian build framework

This is the default extension created to install cloud init to armbian with the build framework. We'll just copy the script from the dir and modify it. In the docs I include the examples I used for reference. Might be outdated always check with the [official source](https://github.com/rpardini/armbian-build/tree/extensions/userpatches/extensions/cloud-init)

you can just ``cp -r extensions/cloud-init userpatches/extensions/cloud-init`` and modify the contents for your patch
