## Networking Stack

For the networking stack my eye has fallen on ´Canal´. There seems to be a native integration with wireguard that could be used to connect pods in different physical networks

## Hardware Stack

the Rock5A SBC with 16GB of ram and 8 cores seems to be the perfect solution for worker nodes. Due to costs I will first use some old 8gb SBC's I still have laying around.
