For the networking stack my eye has fallen on ´Canal´. Because it provides easy to configure VXLAN with Flannel and the advanced features of the Calico project.

the Rock5A SBC with 16GB of ram and 8 cores seems to be the perfect solution for worker nodes. Due to costs I will first use some old 8gb SBC's I still have laying around.
